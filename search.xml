I heavily got inspired by <a href="http://vis4.net/blog/2017/10/goodbye-wordpress/">this blog post</a> and here it is! This took 10+ hours to make, so please consider sharing.</p><h2 id="writing"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#writing"></a> Writing</h2><p>Iâ€™ll write about:</p><ul><li>Programming</li><li>Cooking</li><li>Other random stuff</li></ul><h2 id="how-did-i-make-this"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#how-did-i-make-this"></a> How did I make this?</h2><p>After seeing the post, I just knew that I wanted to make a blog and experiment with Heroku. So, I started with a Heroku account and experimented a bit. I had to install Git and the Heroku CLI. After some testing, I got a Hello World example going. Then I used the <a href="https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus">Cactus ðŸŒµ</a> theme and <code>markdown-it-plus</code> and <code>hexo-generator-search</code>.</p><h3 id="the-problem"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#the-problem"></a> The problem</h3><p>Yep. Always. Hexo generates a static webpage (this was a humongous oversight), so Heroku was not what will work. So I tried GitHub pages, but the files were empty. So in the end I settled on <em>InfinityFreeApp</em>. And here it is.</p>]]></content>
